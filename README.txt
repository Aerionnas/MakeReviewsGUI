Project Title: Address Book

Description: This is a GUI that allows the user to create reviews.

Languages used: Java(Object Oriented Programming and Java Swing)

This project utilizes three different files: Review.java, ReviewApp.java, and
Review.txt.

Review.java- This is a Entry class with attributes, getters, setters, and a toString
method. It contains the blueprint for Entry objects.

ReviewApp.java- this is where the GUI is created. It also contains action listers
for each of the buttons. It also contains the code for the for writing tot the
Review.txt file. This file contains the code needed to run the program.

Review.txt- this is where all of the reviews are stored. It is updated each time
that the GUI runs.

In the future, I would like to update this project so that users are able to
choose which type of review they are creating. I want this program to be similar
to Yelp.

To run this project, compile the ReviewApp.java class and run it in the
terminal.
